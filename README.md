# curvy-cakes

Curvy-cakes is just an experimental app for budgeting and accounting. It is not production ready and it's only used for testing purposes.
The app is written with .NET 6 / ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly. It uses [MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com/) as a Blazor component.

You can check out the code and play with it if you want. Just keep in mind that it is a experimental app ;).
